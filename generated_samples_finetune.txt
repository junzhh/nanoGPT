DUKE VINCENTIO:
Comes the noise?

LUCIO:
I hear a noise; let me go.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What noise?

LUCIO:
The blood of my countrymen
Is being shed in France,
And when I tell you the cause,
You shall judge, ere you can say 'goodbye,'
How I have pity on you and your friends:
Therefore, stay in your houses: watch your walls,
And see your gates shut and your fires burning;
Take time, and, if your sorrow be heavier than fire,
Come back, and seek your countrymen on land.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's this noise?

LUCIO:
Come, let us back.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, good Lord, what is this blood

From them;
And they that heard
Of Grouchy's death and of Paris'
Success make great boast of their good
In the glory of France's victory.

LORD PRINCE EDWARD:
But, cousin, I am fain to stay
Since I have bought my cousin's peace;
Which I may have, if I can speak or move
To bring this matter to a happy issue.

GLOUCESTER:
Neither can I say much, cousin,
That I can do much now, for, though
I came hither to bid you farewell,
I have heard two or three things which I
though it were a world to say, yet it is fair.

LORD PERCY:
My good uncle, I hear my uncle's lord
makes such a forward gesture, that it
sends me back to the Tower. But, gracious
uncle, my cousin is out of danger:


GLOUCESTER:
What is that they say, that you are come
To bid them farewell?

LORD PERCY:
They say, my lord,
That my cousin Grafton is dead,
And that he hath left two or three
To him that should succeed him.

GLOUCESTER:
What do you hear of that?

LORD PERCY:
I hear that my cousin lies dead.

GLOUCESTER:
What think you of that?

LORD PERCY:
No more than that it is true;
Wherefore I must be content.
But, uncle, you know my good cousin
Lives in this Tower--

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, and he did inhabit him too well:
I could tell you his faults even in his life.

LORD PERCY:
It is well, sir;
For it will serve you well, I warrant thee.

GLOUCESTER:
But, uncle, it is not well to live
In this Tower; and had I no other remedy,
I would have had it taken from me awhile:
I have the cause too well in hand;
And ever 'tis the cause that I am in strife.

LORD PERCY:
It is well, uncle, it is well

A second time, she did wearon him;
And no sooner she had his head,
But he came in with his head full of woe.

QUEEN:
My lord, let me speak with my lady:
I have a great piece of news, and I will
speak it with my lord.

THEODORE:
What news is it?

QUEEN:
Such as a man is born to hear.

THEODORE:
How is the lady?

QUEEN:
She is well, my lord.

THEODORE:
Ay, be well, my noble lady.

I was here this morning, my lord; and their queen
danced there.

Hath she danced?

That I did see.

I will hear it with my lady.

QUEEN:
Hath she danced? I saw her dance.

THEODORE:
I'll hear it with my lady.

QUEEN:
Hath she danced? I saw her dance.

THEODORE:
I guess she hath, my lady.

Hath she danced? I saw her dance; but I think
she hath not danced.

And do you live, and be the wife of a king
That hath no son to be king? I
Can never bear thee in my heart.

BENVOLIO:
O, no, if it were
That I had power to live.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A king's wife, fair.

BENVOLIO:
What, may not live?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, but on condition
That thou hast good success in thy love.
Where's Romeo?

BENVOLIO:
At Casa Ussola, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Go thither, and I will come to thee.

BENVOLIO:
I know thy mind; yet do I bid thee go,
To show thyself my friend.

PRINCE EDWARD:
'Tis the queen that's come to see thee;
And, good my lord, let's to her.

BENVOLIO:
I am in no haste.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Thou art so full of care
As dull to the business of love.

BENVOLIO:
No, be thou my friend:
Thou art a shrewd man, true, and not
To know or think what's best for thee,
But run on and be a wooer of thee.
Thou art a wise man, though thou hast
not sense, to weigh of what's best;
For thou hast thy head, and thou wilt make
Ships on the sea of the wisest thing
In all the world; thou wilt be king of
Thy hands, thou wilt be the king of all
Thy friends, and thou wilt be king of thy
parties, and to all thy passions,
Thy heart, thy love, thy love itself, thy
rebellion, thy hatred, thy love of
A man's beauty, thy love of the money,
Thy love of the king, thy love of the world,
Thy love of thy country, thy love of
The people, thy love of thy state,
Thy love of thy friends, thy love of thy

THE PRINCE:
Why, O brother mine,
I have not sworn that I love thee;
And if I did, I would not prove it.

QUEEN:
Nay, then use it not: but I pray thee,
Advance unto my house to-morrow,
And take thy leave of me: thou hast done
The truth before me, and I have sworn
To thee as my brother.

ENGLISH:
This day, to-day, or next, forthwith
Shall we pass away the night's tedious night.

QUEEN:
I pray thee, lighten thy pace, give me a cup
And tell me, good brother, whether I have sinned.

ENGLISH:
Ay, ay, to nothing; thou shalt never sin.

QUEEN:
Which is better, to sin and lose the crown,
Or to sin, lose the crown, and lose thy soul?

ENGLISH:
Thou wilt never sin; thou hast sinned.

QUEEN:
Now, then, I have sinned, and lost my soul.

ENGLISH:
The pain abhors sin, and the joys them rejoice;
Therefore do not sin at all, but try
Whereafter thou wilt lose thy soul:
'Tis ill to make sin of virtue,
Which makes it more virtuous.

QUEEN:
Ay, by my soul, be it as you please.

ENGLISH:
And thou art mine, and I thee, in thee.

QUEEN:
How canst thou steal my joys and thou stealest?

ENGLISH:
If thou wilt spend thy joys, thou wilt spend them
In pleasure and in danger; and thou shalt not
Get it again; for, in my love, I bore thee.

QUEEN:
I thank thee, I thank thee, I thank thee;
For, in my love, I bore thee,
And, in thy love, I bore thee: and when
I was dead, thou wast dead, and I made thee alive.

I thank thee, I thank thee, I thank thee;
For, in my love, I nursed thee

O holy Lord, how are my eyes and
my heart stabb'd to see thee thus?

Theodosius:
Ah, good wife, thy heart is not so
that thou shouldst see me so.

BENVOLIO:
Ay, that was the love between
an ancient friend,
and the good man's son, that with
my sword hath cut
him to the heart.

Theodosius:
Hence, to the Tower of Embassadors.

BENVOLIO:
Ay, and to my wife, the Queen of
Albania.

Theodosius:
And, by my troth, she will not
give thee the diamond; the Queen
deliver'd the jewel to thy brother
with this curse: you cannot find
her, she is gone.

BENVOLIO:
Ay, take it, O God!

Theodosius:
If you find her, you need not curse
her.

BENVOLIO:
Ay, you need not curse her.

I'll fetch thee to the Tower of Embassies.

Ay, and I'll be there to-morrow.

If you find 'em, you need not curse 'em.

Ay, you need not curse 'em.

But, for with being a friend of thy brother,
therefore I will give thee the diamond,
if it please you. But, by my troth,
if you find her, you need not curse her.

Ay, you need not curse her.

Theodosius:
Ye need not curse 'em.

So much the greater need I find.

Not I, O my lady, but by the will of God!

A strange and marvelous joy!

No strange joy, indeed; I am the luckiest man
In all the world,
Such a one as two thirds of mankind might not be.

I knew it before, I took it straight out of your grace,
It is but a tale you tell, that I am the luckiest man
In all the world, a thousand times such as you.

And be a duke again, for all his shame.

Swear to me by Saint George that he means no harm:
I'll have thee hew off thy brows, and hang
The first of thy father's subjects for this.

I only swear by the Prince of Wales,
And that I am the heir of a duke.

Be it so: I am your liege, I'll make thee
A duke.

Against the world.

Now, since I find thee an honest duke,

"The same to you also,
To all of your company;
If I see you about to be sad,
I'll not, but answer you.

GLOUCESTER:
Sir, it is not a quarter of an hour past.

COLUMBUS:
You are gone to bed too late;
And it is a good deal too late.

GLOUCESTER:
It is too late: but you shall not be sorry.

COLUMBUS:
Here's the world about you, that comes so late;
Will not let you sleep: dares not stay, dares not
go to-morrow: dares not go to-morrow,
And yet they say you are gone home:
And therefore you must go to-morrow;
For it must be ten o'clock by this.

GLOUCESTER:
I do fear that's the way with all the rest, sir
Who are all too late being gone to bed.

COLUMBUS:
Sir, I have been too late and too late,
Very late as it is; being myself,
To be sure my time of travelling
Is very late: and I do fear that all
The rest are too late being gone to bed.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, Sir, they go to bed very late,
And that's their excuse for being late:
But, Sir, they must be late, else they are not late,
To keep up their time of going to bed:
They would make better use of their time
If they would be gone to bed at once.

COLUMBUS:
But, Sir, they are too late,
To go to bed, and yet go to bed:
And here I must go to bed, and here I must
sleep, and here I must lie to-night,
If I have enough to sleep for the time
It is in my power to stir and to eat.

GLOUCESTER:
But now be gone
With all diligence: you shall not be late
With all diligence: you are too late.

COLUMBUS:
I do fear I have been too late,
And that all the rest, who come late, are all too late.

Why, Sir
